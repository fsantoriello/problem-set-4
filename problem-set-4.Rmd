# Overview

Take the [datacamp course on joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr) to learn the join verbs.

You will analyze some data in the [`nihexporter`](https://github.com/jayhesselberth/nihexporter) package to answer some questions. The questions will cover methods in `dplyr` including two-table verbs.

First you need to install the `nihexporter` package (and `devtools`, if you don't have it already).

```{r install}
#install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jayhesselberth/nihexporter")
```

Read the [Overview vignette](http://jayhesselberth.github.io/nihexporter/articles/nihexporter.html) to learn the structure of the pacakge. Take a look at two tables from the package:

```{r overview}
library(nihexporter)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(cowplot)

projects
project_io
```

# Problems

## Problem 1

The `projects` and `project_io` tables have the `r intersect(names(projects), names(project_io))` column in common. Use this column to perform a `left_join` and identify the most expensive project for each institute. Project institutes are in the `projects` table, whereas total project costs are available in the `project_io` table. Note you will have to use the `arrange` and `slice` verbs from `dplyr`.

```{r problem_1}
projects %>% 
  select(project.num, institute) %>%
  left_join(project_io) %>%
  select(project.num, institute, total.cost) %>%
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>%
  group_by(institute) %>%
  slice(1:1) %>%
  arrange(desc(total.cost)) -> mostExpensivePerInstitute

mostExpensivePerInstitute

```

## Problem 2

Create a plot that describes the change in output (number of publications) for the most expensive grant from the above list. Note that you cannot use `n.pubs` for this, as that is an aggregate count over time. You need a tbl of following structure, which you can then use to calculate the number of publications each year (hint: use `n()` in a `summarize` statement:

```{r p2_tbl}

mostExpensivePerInstitute %>% 
  ungroup () %>%
  head(1) %>%
  select(project.num) %>%
  left_join(publinks, by = "project.num") %>%
  left_join(publications, by = 'pmid') %>% 
  select(pub.year, pmid) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(pub.year) %>%
  summarize(total.pubs=n())-> pubsPerYear

pubsPerYear

```

```{r problem_2 plot}

ggplot(pubsPerYear, aes(x = pub.year, y = total.pubs)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(0,30) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Publications") +
  ggtitle(paste(mostExpensivePerInstitute %>% 
                ungroup() %>%
                head(1) %>%
                select(project.num), "Output", sep = " ")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

```

## Problem 3

Use the `projects` and `clinical_studies` table to calculate how many clinical studies have been started by projects from each institute.

```{r problem_3}

projects %>% 
  select(project.num, institute) %>% 
  inner_join(clinical_studies) %>% 
  group_by(institute) %>% 
  summarise(total.clinical.trials = n_distinct(trial.id)) -> totalClinicalTrials

totalClinicalTrials

ggplot(totalClinicalTrials, aes(x = institute, y = total.clinical.trials)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", colour = "black", fill = "chartreuse4") +
  theme_cowplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
  

```

## Problem 4

Calculate correlations between `total.cost` and `n.pubs` for each institute. You will need to `join` the `projects` and `project_io` tables to link `institute` with `total.cost` and `n.pubs`. You will then need to use `group_by` and `do` from `dplyr` and `tidy` from `broom` to calculate correlations.

```{r problem_2}
projects %>%
  select(project.num, institute) %>%
  left_join(project_io) %>%
  select(project.num, institute, n.pubs, total.cost) %>%
  distinct(project.num, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  arrange(institute, project.num) -> tab

tab %>%
  group_by(institute) %>%
  do(tidy(cor(.$n.pubs, .$total.cost))) -> corrPubsByCost

corrPubsByCost

```

## Problem 5 (extra credit)

Correlate [`rcr`](https://icite.od.nih.gov/) values from the `publications` table to one of:

- total cost (overall for NIH, or by institute)
- budget mechanism (e.g., RFA, PAR, etc.)
- type of grant (e.g. R01, P01, R21, etc.). 

```{r extra_credit}
```

## Problem 6 (extra extra credit)

Use [`gganimate`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) to illustrate the change in cost of R01s for a few institutes over time.

```{r extra_extra_credit}
```
